# UniOS


Universal Network Operating System

This is the first Universal OS that will include every OS available and every application
that users will share with eachother. The big advantage of this OS is that it will reduce
drasticaly the wrong enviroment impact of the tehnologies on the Nature. The available 
resources will be used as needed and the spendigs for new hardware tehnologies will go 
to companies. The effort will go more to software and improvements of the existing tools
and every person will have acces to all shared resources. 
There will be no need for hardware upgrades for the users and the available resources
will grow quickly and will be improved.
The implementation of this OS is very easy and there will be a quick availability for
the users.

The idea is to have only the encrypted video/audio (WebM) over the network and the 
(mouse/keyboard and other hardware later.) All the input output operations are over 
the network and all big computing goes to servers. This way the resources are shared
and used with the other users and the software licenses are legal because will be 
donated by users and used in common. (Just how many concurrent users the software 
permit and the software donor will have 100% priority for use).

We use WebRTC or other Real Time Communication and export virtual screens to users 
with the applications they need. They have all their work as encrypted backup on 
their hardware and they can schedule the need for the applications. The administration
of resources available are in hands of the software owners and they can retreive the
licenses any time but this way they lose acces to the others software.
So is free for use if you contribute legaly to the shared resources. 
This is a huge OS with huge resources available with distributed computing systems.
