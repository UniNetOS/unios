# UniOS


Universal Network Operating System

This is the first Universal OS that will include every OS available and every application
that users will share with eachother. The big advantage of this OS is that it will reduce
drasticaly the wrong enviroment impact of the tehnologies on the Nature. The available 
resources will be used as needed and the spendigs for new hardware tehnologies will go 
to companies. The effort will go more to software and improvements of the existing tools
and every person will have acces to all shared resources. 
There will be no need for hardware upgrades for the users and the available resources
will grow quickly and will be improved.
The implementation of this OS is very easy and there will be a quick availability for
the users.
